    <h5 class="mb-2">2. Information we collect</h5>

    <h6 class="mt-3 mb-1 small text-uppercase text-muted">2.1 Account &amp; authentication information</h6>
    <p class="small text-muted">
      When you sign in with Google, we receive:
    </p>
    <ul class="small text-muted">
      <li>Your Google account email address</li>
      <li>Your Google account ID (a unique identifier)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small text-muted">
      We use this information to create and identify your CardifyAI account, track your plan and

    </p>

    <h6 class="mt-3 mb-1 small text-uppercase text-muted">2.2 Subscription &amp; billing information</h6>
    <p class="small text-muted">
      If you upgrade to a paid plan, your payment is processed by our payment provider (e.g. Stripe).
      We may store:
    </p>
    <ul class="small text-muted">
      <li>A Stripe customer ID</li>
      <li>Subscription IDs and related plan / price IDs</li>
      <li>Subscription status (active, canceled, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small text-muted">
      We do <strong>not</strong> store your full credit card number on our servers. Payment details
      are handled and stored securely by Stripe or any other PCI-compliant payment processor we use.
    </p>

    <h6 class="mt-3 mb-1 small text-uppercase text-muted">2.3 Content you provide (notes, PDFs, flashcards)</h6>
    <p class="small text-muted">
      When you use CardifyAI, you may provide:
    </p>

      <li>Flashcards generated for your account</li>
      <li>Reviews or feedback you submit about the app</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small text-muted">
      This content may be temporarily processed by AI models to generate flashcards.
      We store your resulting flashcards and may keep limited logs or usage statistics to
      operate and improve the service. We do not sell your raw study materials.
    </p>

    <h6 class="mt-3 mb-1 small text-uppercase text-muted">2.4 Browser extension information</h6>
    <p class="small text-muted">

      <li>Read highlighted text on the page that you explicitly choose to send to CardifyAI.</li>
      <li>Communicate with <code>cardifylabs.com</code> to create flashcards and open your dashboard.</li>
      <li>Store a small preference (like your last used number of cards) in browser storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small text-muted">
      The extension does <strong>not</strong> collect your browsing history, keystrokes, or other
      website content beyond the specific text you highlight and choose to send.
    </p>

    <h6 class="mt-3 mb-1 small text-uppercase text-muted">2.5 Usage, analytics &amp; log data</h6>
    <p class="small text-muted">

    </ul>
    <p class="small text-muted">
      We may use first-party analytics or privacy-focused third-party analytics tools to understand
      aggregate usage patterns. We do not use analytics to uniquely fingerprint you for advertising.
